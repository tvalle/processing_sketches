# Sketches

This repository has a bunch of experiments, tests, throw away code that may be useful to some(and future me) as reference so I decided to put this here. It's basically a bunch of [Processing](https://processing.org/) sketches where I try to do some effects, animations or some algorithm. Some may be documented, some may be not, no guarantees here.

Feel free to use as you wish.

## Build

In order to build just copy or download the sketch you want to try out and run it using the [Processing editor](https://processing.org/download).
